  Hey there! This page is about me and my research since my OHSU (Portland) stay. Carry on!
</p>

The novel, *Zuzana is having fun doing research*, starts with describing fails of reading e-mails, getting of the bus and others that led to great consequences. Further is yet to be defined but, as usual, will be a lot of fun. The formal website can be found [@zuz_rg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zuzana_Tatarova).
